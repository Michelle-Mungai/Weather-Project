PROJECT OWNER: Michelle Mungai
PROJECT NAME: Simple Weather Application

PROBLEM STATEMENT

I discovered that users can get too busy at home or at work to even look up and check the current weather 
conditions of where they are or where they might be heading to after work. 
Furthermore, many of the free weather software programs have too many pop ups and unwanted software linked 
to them causing bugs. 

SOLUTION 

Create a simple weather app that is meant to solve all these issues by having the application show weather in 
real time and has no external sites linked to it.
